\section{Introduction}
This is the notes based on a weekly  seminar on simplicial homotopy theory. We mainly discussed simplicial objects in a category. I will give some motivation for the category of simplicial sets.

The origin of simplicial homotopy theory coincides with the beginning of algebraic topology. In algebraic topology, one studies homology and homotopy groups of topological spaces. We will recall some fundamental notions from algebraic topology.

\section{Fundamentals of Algebraic Topology}

In algebraic topology, we study topological spaces using algebraic methods. The main idea is to associate algebraic objects (like groups, rings, modules) to topological spaces in a way that captures their essential features. This allows us to use algebraic techniques to solve topological problems.

Note that topological space is a most general setting which is an abstraction of geometric objects. However, there are lots of topological spaces including the pathological ones. Therefore, in mathematics we usually restrict our attention to "nice" topological spaces that have good properties and can be studied effectively.
In general, we have 3 types of models for "nice" topological spaces:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Smooth Manifolds:} These are topological spaces that locally resemble Euclidean space and have a smooth structure, allowing for the definition of differentiable functions. This is more suitable for analysis and differential geometry.
    \item \textbf{Simplicial Complexes:} These are combinatorial structures and they are suitable for combinatorics and algebra. The maps are very rigid in this model. Therefore, they are not suitable for topology because they are not flexible with continuous deformations.
    \item \textbf{CW Complexes:} These are built from cells of various dimensions (0-cells, 1-cells, 2-cells, etc.) that are attached in a specific manner. CW complexes are very flexible and can model a wide variety of topological spaces. This is more suitable for homotopy theory and algebraic topology.
\end{itemize}

There are 2 main approaches in algebraic topology, namely the \emph{homology} and \emph{homotopy} theories.
Homology theory by construction is highly combinatorial in nature. It uses combinatorial models of topological spaces, such as simplicial complexes. Therefore, it is easier to compute than homotopy theory.

Homotopy theory, on the other hand, deals with the notion of continuous deformation. It studies spaces up to homotopy equivalence. The aim of simplicial homotopy theory is to provide a combinatorial framework for homotopy theory using simplexes.
In this section, we will review the basic definitions and properties of simplices and singular homology.
\subsection{Simplex }

The points of a finite set $P = \{p_0, p_1, \dots, p_k\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are said to be \emph{affinely independent} if they are not contained in any affine subspace of dimension less than $k$. In other words, the set
\[
    \{p_1 - p_0, p_2 - p_0, \dots, p_k - p_0\}
\]
is a linearly independent set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$.

\begin{definition}[Simplex]
    Given a set $P = \{p_0, p_1, \dots, p_k\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of affinely independent points, the $k$-dimensional \emph{simplex} $\sigma$ (or $k$-simplex) spanned by $P$ is the set of convex combinations:
    \[
        \sum_{i=0}^{k} \lambda_i p_i, \quad \text{where } \lambda_i \geq 0, \ \sum_{i=0}^{k} \lambda_i = 1.
    \]
\end{definition}

The elements of $P$ are called the \emph{vertices} of the $k$-simplex $\sigma$.

\begin{example}
    \leavevmode
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A $0$-simplex is a point in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
        \item A $1$-simplex is a line segment between two points.
        \item A $2$-simplex is a filled-in triangle.
        \item A $3$-simplex is a filled-in tetrahedron.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

The \emph{standard $n$-simplex} $\Delta^n$ is the subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ given by
\[
    \Delta^n = \left\{ (t_0, t_1, \dots, t_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \ \middle| \ t_i \geq 0,\ \sum_{i=0}^{n} t_i = 1 \right\}.
\]
The coordinates $t_i$ are called \emph{barycentric coordinates}. Here are

\begin{center}

\end{center}

A face of a $k$-simplex $\sigma$ is the simplex spanned by a nonempty subset of the vertices of $\sigma$. In particular, the faces of a $k$-simplex include the simplex itself and its vertices.
As an example, a $2$-simplex has three $1$-dimensional faces (edges) and three $0$-dimensional faces (vertices).
\subsection{Geometric Simplicial Complexes}

A geometric simplicial complex is a collection of simplices that fit together in a nice way.



\begin{definition}[Simplicial Complex]
    A \emph{simplicial complex} $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a collection of simplices satisfying the following conditions:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item If $\sigma \in K$ is a simplex, then every face of $\sigma$ is also in $K$.
        \item If $\sigma, \tau \in K$, then their intersection is either empty or a face of both $\sigma$ and $\tau$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\textcolor{red}{Buraya bir tane örnek resim  koy.}



\begin{remark}
    For a simplicial complex $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, its \emph{geometric realization} $|K| \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is the union of the simplices of $K$. The topology on $|K|$ is the standard Euclidean topology.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    A topological space $M$ is called \emph{triangulable} if it is homeomorphic to $|K|$ for some simplicial complex $K$. The space $|K|$ is then called a \emph{triangulation} of $M$. Not every topological space is triangulable, and a triangulation, when it exists, is not unique.
\end{remark}

As usual in mathematics we want to define structure-preserving maps between two objects. In this case , we say a map between two simplicial complexes is a simplicial map if it sends simplices to simplices in an affine way.

\begin{definition}[Simplicial Map between GSCs]
    Let $K$ and $L$ be geometric simplicial complexes. A map $f : K \to L$ is called a \emph{simplicial map} if:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For every simplex $\sigma \in K$, the image $f(\sigma)$ is contained in some simplex of $L$.
        \item The map $f$ is affine when restricted to each simplex of $K$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    Let $K$ be a triangle with vertices $v_0, v_1, v_2$, and $L$ be a segment with vertices $w_0, w_1$.

    Define $f$ by:
    \[
        f(v_0) = w_0, \quad f(v_1) = w_1, \quad f(v_2) = w_1.
    \]

    Then $f$ is a simplicial map. Geometrically, we have:
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2, every node/.style={font=\small}]
            % Triangle K (filled)
            \fill[blue!15, opacity=0.7] (0,0) -- (2,1) -- (2,-1) -- cycle;
            \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (2,1) -- (2,-1) -- cycle;
            \node[left] (v0) at (0,0) {$v_0$};
            \node[above right] (v1) at (2,1) {$v_1$};
            \node[below right] (v2) at (2,-1) {$v_2$};
            \node at (1, 1.4) {$K$};

            % Segment L
            \draw[thick] (5,0.5) -- (7,0.5);
            \node[above] (w0) at (5,0.5) {$w_0$};
            \node[above] (w1) at (7,0.5) {$w_1$};
            \node at (6, 1.2) {$L$};

            % Arrows from K to L
            \draw[->, thick, red, dotted] (v0) to[bend left=20] (w0);
            \draw[->, thick, red, dotted] (v1) to[bend left=10] (w1);
            \draw[->, thick, red, dotted] (v2) to[bend right=10] (w1);

        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The map $f$ is affine on each face and sends simplices in $K$ to simplices in $L$.
\end{example}

Geometric simplicial complexes are not combinatorial objects. However, we can encode the combinatorial data of a geometric simplicial complex in a purely combinatorial way. This leads us to the notion of abstract simplicial complexes.

\subsection{Abstract Simplicial Complexes}

To define a combinatorial version of a simplicial complex, we start with a finite set interpreted as vertices and consider certain subsets of it interpreted as faces.


\begin{definition}[Abstract Simplicial Complex]
    Let X be a finite set. An \emph{abstract simplicial complex} is a pair $(X, \Delta)$, where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Delta$ is a collection of nonempty subsets of $X$ (called \emph{simplices}) such that:

              If $\sigma \in \Delta$ and $\tau \subseteq \sigma$, then $\tau \in \Delta$.

    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    Let $X = \{a, b, c, d\}$. Define a simplicial complex $\Delta$ by:
    \[
        \Delta = \{ \emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{d\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,b,c\} \}.
    \]
\end{example}
Geometrically, this can be visualized as a triangle with vertices $a, b, c$ and an isolated vertex $d$.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2, every node/.style={font=\small}]
        % Triangle for a,b,c
        \coordinate (a) at (0,0);
        \coordinate (b) at (2,1.5);
        \coordinate (c) at (2,-1.5);
        \coordinate (d) at (4,0);

        % Draw triangle
        \fill[black!15, opacity=0.7] (a) -- (b) -- (c) -- cycle;
        \draw[thick] (a) -- (b) -- (c) -- (a);

        % Draw isolated vertex d
        \fill[black] (d) circle (2pt);
        \node[right] at (d) {$d$};

        % Draw vertices
        \fill[black] (a) circle (2pt);
        \fill[black] (b) circle (2pt);
        \fill[black] (c) circle (2pt);

        % Vertex labels
        \node[left] at (a) {$a$};
        \node[above right] at (b) {$b$};
        \node[below right] at (c) {$c$};

        % Edge labels (optional)
        %\node at ($(a)!0.5!(b)+(0,0.2)$) {$\{a,b\}$};
        %\node at ($(a)!0.5!(c)+(-0.1,-0.2)$) {$\{a,c\}$};
        %\node at ($(b)!0.5!(c)+(0.2,0)$) {$\{b,c\}$};

        % Triangle label
        \node at (1.2,0) {$\{a,b,c\}$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{example}[Non-example]
    Let $X = \{a, b, c\}$ and define
    \[
        \Delta' = \{ \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a,b\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,b,c\} \}.
    \]
    This is \emph{not} an abstract simplicial complex, because $\{a,c\}$ is a subset of $\{a,b,c\}$ but $\{a,c\} \notin \Delta'$. The definition requires that every nonempty subset of a simplex is also a simplex.
\end{example}

\paragraph{Terminology:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Elements of $\Delta$ are called \emph{faces}.
    \item The \emph{dimension} of a face $\tau$ is $\#\tau - 1$.
    \item The \emph{dimension} of $\Delta$ is the maximum of the dimensions of its faces.
    \item $0$-dimensional faces are called \emph{vertices}.
    \item $1$-dimensional faces are called \emph{edges}.
    \item A simplicial complex of dimension at most $1$ is called a \emph{(multi-)graph}.
    \item A subcollection $\Delta' \subset \Delta$ that is itself a simplicial complex is called a \emph{subcomplex}.
    \item The \emph{$k$-skeleton} of $\Delta$ is the subcomplex consisting of all faces of dimension at most $k$.
\end{itemize}

Again , we want to define structure-preserving maps between two abstract simplicial complexes. In this case , we say a map between two abstract simplicial complexes is a simplicial map if it sends simplices to simplices.
More precisely:
\begin{definition}[Simplicial Map between ASCs]
    Let $(X, \Delta)$ and $(Y, \Gamma)$ be two abstract simplicial complexes.
    A \emph{simplicial map} $f : (X, \Delta) \to (Y, \Gamma)$ is a function $f : X \to Y$ such that for every simplex $\sigma \in \Delta$, the image $f(\sigma) := \{ f(v) \mid v \in \sigma \}$ belongs to $\Gamma$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    Let:
    \[
        X = \{a, b, c\}, \quad \Delta = \{\{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,c\}\}
    \]
    \[
        Y = \{x, y\}, \quad \Gamma = \{\{x\}, \{y\}, \{x,y\}\}
    \]
    Define $f(a) = x$, $f(b) = y$, $f(c) = y$.

    Then $f$ is a simplicial map because the image of every simplex in $\Delta$ is a simplex in $\Gamma$.

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2, every node/.style={font=\small}]
            % Domain complex
            \node (a) at (0,0) {$a$};
            \node (b) at (1,1) {$b$};
            \node (c) at (1,-1) {$c$};
            \draw (a) -- (b);
            \draw (a) -- (c);
            \node at (0.5, 1.2) {$(X, \Delta)$};

            % Codomain complex
            \node (x) at (4,0.5) {$x$};
            \node (y) at (5,0.5) {$y$};
            \draw (x) -- (y);
            \node at (4.5, 1.2) {$(Y, \Gamma)$};

            % Arrows
            \draw[->, thick] (a) to[bend left=20] (x);
            \draw[->, thick] (b) to[bend left=10] (y);
            \draw[->, thick] (c) to[bend right=10] (y);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

\end{example}






\subsection{Relation Between Geometric and Abstract Simplicial Complexes}

In this section, we define maps between abstract and geometric simplicial complexes and explore how abstract simplicial complexes can be realized geometrically.

\textbf{-From Abstract to Geometric: Geometric Realization}

Given an abstract simplicial complex $(X, \Delta)$, we can associate to it a topological space known as its \emph{geometric realization}, denoted $|\Delta|$.

\begin{definition}[Geometric Realization of an ASC]
    Let $(X, \Delta)$ be an abstract simplicial complex. The \emph{geometric realization} $|\Delta|$ is a topological space constructed as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assign to each vertex $v \in X$ a point $e_v$ in some Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the set $\{e_v \mid v \in X\}$ is affinely independent.
        \item For each simplex $\{v_0, \dots, v_k\} \in \Delta$, define the geometric $k$-simplex as:
              \[
                  \sigma = \left\{ \sum_{i=0}^{k} \lambda_i e_{v_i} \ \middle| \ \lambda_i \geq 0,\ \sum_{i=0}^{k} \lambda_i = 1 \right\}.
              \]
        \item The space $|\Delta|$ is the union of these geometric simplices, equipped with the subspace topology from $\mathbb{R}^n$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\textbf{-From Geometric to Abstract}

Given a geometric simplicial complex $K$, we can form an abstract simplicial complex $(X, \Delta)$ by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Letting $X$ be the set of vertices of $K$.
    \item Defining $\Delta$ to be the set of all finite subsets of $X$ that span simplices in $K$.
\end{itemize}

This correspondence defines a functorial relation between geometric and abstract simplicial complexes. However, note that geometric realizations are not unique — different embeddings can yield homeomorphic topological spaces.





\subsection{Singular Homology}

Singular homology is a fundamental tool in algebraic topology that assigns to each topological space a sequence of abelian groups (or modules), capturing information about its shape.


The standard simplices related by face inclusions:
\[
    d^i : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^n \\
\]
\[
    d^i(t_0, \ldots, t_{n-1}) = (t_0, \ldots, t_{i-1}, 0, t_i, \ldots, t_{n-1}).
\]

For $0 \leq i \leq n $, the face map $d^i$ is the affine map that sends vertices to vertices in order and omits the  $i$-th vertex of the simplex $\Delta^n$.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=5cm]{face_maps.jpg}
\end{center}


\begin{definition}[Singular $n$-Simplex]
    Let $X$ be a topological space.  A \emph{singular $n$-simplex} in a topological space $X$ is a continuous map $\sigma : \Delta^n \to X$, where $\Delta^n$ is the standard $n$-simplex.
    The set of all singular $n$-simplices in $X$ is denoted by $Sin_n(X)$.
\end{definition}

        \node (B) at (3,2) {$\Delta^n$};
        \node (C) at (3,0) {$X$};

        % Arrows

Therefore, the face map $d^i$ induce a map from the singular $n$-simplex $\sigma$ to the singular $(n-1)$-simplex $\sigma \circ d^i$. We have a map
\[
    d_i : Sin_n(X) \to Sin_{n-1}(X)
\]
\[
    d_i(\sigma)=\sigma \circ d^i
\]


\begin{definition}
    The Abelian group $S_n(X)$ of singular $n$-simplices in $X$ is defined as the free abelian group generated by all singular $n$-simplices in $X$. That is \[
        S_n(X)=\mathbb{Z}Sin_n(X)  \]
\end{definition}



For each $n \geq 1$, define the boundary operator $\partial_n : Sin_n(X) \to S_{n-1}(X)$ by
\[
    \partial_n(\sigma) = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i d_i(\sigma) = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i \sigma \circ d^i,
\]
where $d_i : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^n$ is the $i$-th face map (inclusion of the $i$-th face).

This extends linearly to all of $S_n(X)$. One can check that $\partial_{n-1} \circ \partial_n = 0$ for all $n$, which is the most important property of the boundary operator.
This gives  a sequence of abelian groups and homomorphisms
\[
    \cdots \xrightarrow{\partial_{n+1}} S_n(X) \xrightarrow{\partial_n} S_{n-1}(X) \xrightarrow{\partial_{n-1}} \cdots \xrightarrow{\partial_1} S_0(X) \to 0.
\]
This sequence is called a \emph{ chain complex}  because $\partial_{n-1} \circ \partial_n = 0$ for all $n$. This property gives that  $\operatorname{im} \partial_{n+1} \subseteq \ker \partial_n$.

The $n$-th \emph{singular homology group} of $X$ is defined as

\[
    H_n(X) = \frac{\ker \partial_n}{\operatorname{im} \partial_{n+1}}.
\]

To define singular homology we used face maps between standard simplices. To define face maps we need to consider the standard simplices as oriented. These face maps can be seen as  order-preserving maps combinatorially. In fact, any order-preserving map between totally ordered sets induces an affine map between standard simplices.

\subsection{Ordered Simplicial Complexes}

An \emph{ordered simplicial complex} is an abstract simplicial complex equipped with a total ordering on its vertex set. This extra structure allows us to distinguish between different orderings of the same simplex, which is important in applications such as defining orientations or working with simplicial sets.

\begin{definition}[Ordered Simplicial Complex]
    An \emph{ordered simplicial complex} is a pair $(X, \Delta)$, where $X$ is a finite set with a total order, and $\Delta$ is a collection of nonempty subsets of $X$ such that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $\sigma \in \Delta$ and $\tau \subseteq \sigma$, then $\tau \in \Delta$.
    \end{itemize}
    Each simplex $\sigma = \{v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_k\}$ is considered together with the induced order $v_0 < v_1 < \cdots < v_k$ from $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    Let $X = \{a, b, c\}$ with $a < b < c$. Define
    \[
        \Delta = \{ \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a,b\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,b,c\} \}.
    \]
    Then $(X, \Delta)$ is an ordered simplicial complex. The $2$-simplex $\{a,b,c\}$ has the ordering $a < b < c$.
\end{example}


\begin{definition}[Simplicial Map between Ordered Simplicial  Complexes]
    Let $(X, \Delta)$ and $(Y, \Gamma)$ be ordered simplicial complexes, where $X$ and $Y$ are totally ordered sets. A \emph{simplicial map} $f : (X, \Delta) \to (Y, \Gamma)$ is a function $f : X \to Y$ such that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $f$ is order-preserving: if $v < w$ in $X$, then $f(v) < f(w)$ in $Y$,
        \item for every simplex $\sigma \in \Delta$, the image $f(\sigma) := \{ f(v) \mid v \in \sigma \}$ is a simplex in $\Gamma$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Exercise.} Answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Let $[n] $ denote the totally ordered set $\{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$. Let $\phi : [n] \to [m]$ be an order-preserving function(so that if $i \leq j$, then
          $\phi(i) \leq \phi(j)$). Identify the elements of $[n] $ with the vertices of
          the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$. Show that $\phi$ induces an affine map $\Delta^n \to \Delta^m$. Give a formula for the induced map $\phi$

    \item Verify that $s^j \circ s^i = s^{i+1} \circ s^j$ if $i \leq j$.
    \item Find a formula for $s^i \circ d^j $
\end{enumerate}






\section{Simplex Category}





We will start by solving the exercises in  the end of the previous section.
Recall that $[n]$ denotes the totally ordered set $\{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Let $ \{e_0,e_1,..e_{n-1}\} $ be the standard basis for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ,i.e
          \[
              e_i = (0, \ldots, 0, 1, 0, \ldots, 0) \in \mathbb{R}^{n}
          \] where the $1$ is in the $i+1$-th position. Note that we have different indexing from the usual.
          . Then, $\Delta^n$ can be seen as a convex hull of the points $\{e_0,e_1,\ldots,e_{n-1} \}$.That is, for any point $p \in \Delta^n$, there exist non-negative real numbers $t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_{n-1}$ such that $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} t_i = 1$ and
          \[
              p = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} t_i e_i.
          \]
          For an order-preserving function $\phi : [n] \to [m]$ we have a induced map  $\Phi : \Delta^n \to \Delta^m$  given by
          \[
              \Phi(p) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} t_i e_{\phi(i)}.
          \]


    \item Write $d^j : [n-1] \to [n] $ for the order-preserving map that skips the $j$-th element. Show that any order-preserving injection $\phi : [n-k] \to [n]$ can be written uniquely as a composition of the form $d^{j_k} \circ d^{j_{k-1}} \circ \cdots \circ d^{j_1}$ with $ 0 \leq j_1 < j_2 < \cdots < j_k \leq n$.
    \item Verify that $d^j \circ d^i = d^{i+1} \circ d^j$ if $i < j$.
    \item Show that any order-preserving map $\phi : [n] \to [m]$ can be written uniquely as a composition of an order-preserving injection $\phi' : [n-k] \to [m]$ followed by a surjective order-preserving map $\psi : [m] \to [m-k]$.
    \item Write $s^j : [n+1] \to [n]$ for the order-preserving map that repeats the $j$-th element. Show that any order-preserving surjection $\psi : [m] \to [n]$ can be written uniquely as a composition of the form $s^{j_k} \circ s^{j_{k-1}} \circ \cdots \circ s^{j_1}$ with $ 0 \leq j_1 < j_2 < \cdots < j_k \leq m$.
    \item Verify that $s^j \circ s^i = s^{i+1} \circ s^j$ if $i \leq j$.
    \item Find a formula for $s^i \circ d^j $
\end{enumerate}



\textcolor{red}{Buraya bir bak}


We will need those relations to study simplex category.



First, let us look at the poset category in more detail.
We know that a partially ordered set $(X,\leq)$ is a category where the objects are the elements of X and there is a unique morphism from $x$ to $y$ if $x \leq y$.
Consider two posets $(X,\leq)$ and $(Y,\leq)$  What is a functor between them?
Let F be a funtor from X to Y.
Then F consists of the following data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each $x \in X$, an object $F(x) \in Y$. This just says that $F$ is a a function from $X$ to $Y$.
    \item For each $f \in Hom(x_1,x_2)$, a morphism $F(f) \in Hom(F(x_1),F(x_2))$.
          This means that if $x_1 \leq x_2$ in $X$, then $F(x_1) \leq F(x_2)$ in $Y$. In other words, $F$ is an order-preserving function.
\end{itemize}


Here is the main ingredient of the theory.
\begin{definition}[Simplex Category]
    The \emph{simplex category} $\Delta$ is the category whose objects are the finite ordered sets $[n] = \{0,1,\dots,n\}$ for $n \geq 0$, and whose morphisms are order-preserving (non-decreasing) functions between them.
\end{definition}

Note that in this category , each object is a category itself and morphisms are functors between them.

\begin{example}

    Here is a list of all morphisms from $\mathbf{[2]}$ to $\mathbf{[1]}$ ,i.e. order-preserving functions $\phi : [2] \to [1]$.

There is an easy way to represents morphisms from $[n]$ to $[m]$ in $\Delta$. Since $f$ is an order-preserving map, the image of $f$ is a non-decreasing sequence of elements in $[m]$ of length $n+1$.
For example, we can represent the morphism in the examples above as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item From $[2]$ to $[1]$:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item $f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f(2)=0$  represented as (0,0,0)
              \item $f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f(2)=1$  represented as (0,0,1)
              \item $f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(2)=1$  represented as (0,1,1)
              \item $f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1$  represented as (1,1,1)
          \end{itemize}
    \item From $[1]$ to $[2]$:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item $f(0)=0, f(1)=0$  represented as (0,0)
              \item $f(0)=0, f(1)=1$  represented as (0,1)
              \item $f(0)=0, f(1)=2$  represented as (0,2)
              \item $f(0)=1, f(1)=1$  represented as (1,1)
              \item $f(0)=1, f(1)=2$  represented as (1,2)
              \item $f(0)=2, f(1)=2$  represented as (2,2)
          \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

    The morphisms in the simplex category $\Delta$ are not necessarily injective. There is also a category of finite ordered sets, with injective order-preserving maps as morphisms.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Delta Category ]
    The \emph{category} $\Delta_{inj} $ is the category whose objects are the finite ordered sets $[n] = \{0,1,\dots,n\}$ for each $n \geq 0$, and whose morphisms are all injective order-preserving  functions between them. That is, a morphism $\phi : [n] \to [m]$ satisfies $\phi(i) < \phi(j)$ whenever $i < j$.
\end{definition}
Note that if $ m<n$ then $Hom_{\Delta_{inj}}([n],[m]) = \emptyset$.
Thus, we do not have morphisms from $[2]$ to $[1]$. However we do have morphisms from $[1]$ to $[2]$ in $\Delta_{inj}$. As an example , look at the example 6.3 , 3 of the morphisms are injective.

We will not use the category $\Delta_{inj}$ in this course, but it is worth noting that it is a subcategory of the simplex category $\Delta$.



There are special morphisms in the simplex category $\Delta$ that is a generating set for the morphisms in $\Delta$.

\begin{definition}[co-Face and co-Degeneracy Maps]
    For each $n \geq 0$, the simplex category $\Delta$ has special morphisms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The $i$-th \emph{co-face map} $d^i : [n-1] \to [n]$ is the injective order-preserving map that skips $i$. Here is the formula for the $i$-th co-face map:
              \begin{align*}
                  d^i : [n-1] & \to [n] \\
                  d^i(x)      & =
                  \begin{cases}
                      x     & \text{if } x < i    \\
                      x + 1 & \text{if } x \geq i
                  \end{cases}
              \end{align*}

        \item The $i$-th \emph{co-degeneracy map} $s^i : [n+1] \to [n]$ is the surjective order-preserving map that repeats $i$. Here is the formula for the $i$-th co-degeneracy map:

              \begin{align*}
                  s^i : [n+1] & \to [n] \\
                  s^i(x)      & =
                  \begin{cases}
                      x     & \text{if } x \leq i \\
                      x - 1 & \text{if } x > i
                  \end{cases}
              \end{align*}

    \end{itemize}


\end{definition}
Any morphism in the simplex category $\Delta$ can be expressed as a composition of a surjection followed by an injection. In the exercise at the end of the 4th chapter, we asked you to verify any injection order-preserving map can be expressed as a composition of the co-face maps.
Similarly, any surjection order-preserving map can be expressed as a composition of the co-degeneracy maps. Therefore, co-face and co-degeneracy maps generate the morphisms in the simplex category $\Delta$.
However , they are not free generators, they satisfy some identities.

\begin{proposition}[Cosimplicial Identities]
    The co-face and co-degeneracy maps in the simplex category $\Delta$ satisfy the following \emph{cosimplicial identities} for all $i, j$:
    \begin{align*}
        d^j d^i & = d^i d^{j-1} \quad \text{if } i < j      \\
        s^j s^i & = s^{i} s^{j+1} \quad \text{if } i \leq j \\
        s^j d^i & =
        \begin{cases}
            d^i s^{j-1} & \text{if } i < j                     \\
            \mathrm{id} & \text{if } i = j \text{ or } i = j+1 \\
            d^{i-1} s^j & \text{if } i > j+1
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
\end{proposition}

\section{Simplicial Sets}
Now, we are ready to define simplicial sets.
\begin{definition}
    A \emph{simplicial set} is a functor $X: \Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$, where $\Delta$ is the simplex category.
\end{definition}

Let us elaborate this definition. for each $n \geq 0$, the simplicial set $X$ assigns a set $X_n = X([n])$.
for each morphism $f: [m] \to [n]$ in $\Delta^{op}$, we have a map $X(f): X_n \to X_m$.
We know that each morphisms in $\Delta$ is a composition of co-face and co-degeneracy maps. Let us denote the face maps by $d_i=X(d^i)$ and the degeneracy maps by $s_i=X(s^i)$. Then, we have the following maps for each $n \geq 0$:
\[
    d_i : X_n \to X_{n-1} \quad (0 \leq i \leq n), \qquad s_i : X_n \to X_{n+1} \quad (0 \leq i \leq n)
\]
satisfying the \emph{simplicial identities}:
\begin{align*}
    d_i d_j & = d_{j-1} d_i \quad \text{if } i < j    \\
    s_i s_j & = s_{j+1} s_i \quad \text{if } i \leq j \\
    d_i s_j & =
    \begin{cases}
        s_{j-1} d_i & \text{if } i < j                     \\
        \mathrm{id} & \text{if } i = j \text{ or } i = j+1 \\
        s_j d_{i-1} & \text{if } i > j+1
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

These maps are called the \emph{face maps} and \emph{degeneracy maps} of the simplicial set $X$.







\begin{example}[Standard $n$-Simplex]
    In the simplex category $\Delta$, $Hom_\Delta([k],[n])$ is a set, that is,
    $Hom_\Delta([k],[n]) \in \mathbf{Set}$.
    For fixed $[n]$, we can define a functor $\Delta[n] : \Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ by setting $\Delta[n]([k]) = Hom_\Delta([k],[n])$ and
    For a morphism $\phi : [l] \to [k]$ in $\Delta$, we can define

    \[
        \Delta[n](\phi) : Hom_\Delta([k],[n]) \to Hom_\Delta([l],[n]), \quad f \mapsto f \circ \phi
    \]
    This defines a  functor and so it is a simplicial set.  This simplicial set is called the \emph{standard $n$-simplex} because its geometric realization is homeomorphic to the standard geometric $n$-simplex.

    \paragraph{}
    There is an equivalent way to describe the standard $n$-simplex. The set $\Delta[n]_k = Hom_\Delta([k],[n])$ is the set of non-decreasing functions from $\{0,1,\dots,k\}$ to $\{0,1,\dots,n\}$. Such a function is determined by the image of each element in $\{0,1,\dots,k\}$. Since the function is non-decreasing, the image of $i$ must be less than or equal to the image of $i+1$. Therefore, a non-decreasing function from $\{0,1,\dots,k\}$ to $\{0,1,\dots,n\}$ corresponds to a sequence of $k+1$ elements in $\{0,1,\dots,n\}$ that is non-decreasing. In other words, we can identify $\Delta[n]_k$ with the set of $(k+1)$-tuples $(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_k)$ such that $0 \leq x_0 \leq x_1 \leq \cdots \leq x_k \leq n$.
    The face and degeneracy maps for the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta[n]$ can be described explicitly as follows. Recall that $\Delta[n]_k$ consists of all non-decreasing sequences $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ with $0 \leq x_0 \leq x_1 \leq \cdots \leq x_k \leq n$.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The $i$-th face map $d_i : \Delta[n]_k \to \Delta[n]_{k-1}$ is given by deleting the $i$-th entry:
              \[
                  d_i(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_k) = (x_0, \ldots, \widehat{x_i}, \ldots, x_k)
              \]
              where $\widehat{x_i}$ means that $x_i$ is omitted.

        \item The $i$-th degeneracy map $s_i : \Delta[n]_k \to \Delta[n]_{k+1}$ is given by repeating the $i$-th entry:
              \[
                  s_i(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_k) = (x_0, \ldots, x_i, x_i, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_k)
              \]
    \end{itemize}

\end{example}


\begin{example}
    Let $X$ be a set and let $K_n =\prod_{i=0}^n X=X^{n+1}$ be the set of $(n+1)$-tuples of elements in $X$. Then, we can define a simplicial set $K$ as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each $n \geq 0$, let $K_n = X^{n+1}$.
        \item The face maps $d_i : K_n \to K_{n-1}$ are defined by forgetting the $i$-th element of the tuple.
              \begin{align*}
                  d_i(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n) & = (x_0, \ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_n) \quad (0 \leq i \leq n)
              \end{align*}
        \item The degeneracy maps $s_i : K_n \to K_{n+1}$ are defined by repeating the $i$-th element of the tuple.
              \begin{align*}
                  s_i(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n) & = (x_0, \ldots, x_i, x_i, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_n) \quad (0 \leq i \leq n)
              \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}

\end{example}


To form a category of simplicial sets, we need to define morphisms between them.


\begin{definition}[Simplicial Map]
    Let $X, Y : \Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ be simplicial sets. A \emph{simplicial map} $f : X \to Y$ is a natural transformation of functors; that is, for each $n \geq 0$, a function $f_n : X_n \to Y_n$ such that for every morphism $\phi : [m] \to [n]$ in $\Delta$, the following diagram commutes:
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            X_n \arrow[r,"f_n"] \arrow[d,"X(\phi)"'] & Y_n \arrow[d,"Y(\phi)"] \\
            X_m \arrow[r,"f_m"'] & Y_m
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]

\end{definition}

Let's elaborate the definition. A simplicial map $f : X \to Y$ between simplicial sets consists of a sequence of functions $f_n : X_n \to Y_n$ for each $n \geq 0$, compatible with the face and degeneracy maps. That is, for all $n \geq 0$ and $0 \leq i \leq n$, the following diagrams commute:
\[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        X_n \arrow[r,"f_n"] \arrow[d,"d_i"'] & Y_n \arrow[d,"d_i"] \\
        X_{n-1} \arrow[r,"f_{n-1}"'] & Y_{n-1}
    \end{tikzcd}
    \qquad
    \begin{tikzcd}
        X_n \arrow[r,"f_n"] \arrow[d,"s_i"'] & Y_n \arrow[d,"s_i"] \\
        X_{n+1} \arrow[r,"f_{n+1}"'] & Y_{n+1}
    \end{tikzcd}
\]
In other words, $f$ preserves the simplicial structure: it sends $n$-simplices to $n$-simplices in a way that is compatible with taking faces and degeneracies. This is analogous to how a continuous map between topological spaces preserves the structure of open sets, or how a group homomorphism preserves the group operation.


Hence ,we can define a category of simplicial sets whose objects are simplicial sets and morphisms are simplicial maps. We denote this category by $\mathbf{sSet}$.




\begin{example}
    We will try to describe simplicial maps between $\Delta[n]$ and $\Delta[m]$.
    Consider an order-preserving map $f: [n] \to [m]$ in $\Delta$. Recall that this map induces an affine map from $\Delta^n$ to $\Delta^m$ (the geometric simplicial complexes).
    We will do a similar thing for the standard simplicial sets. Remember that $\Delta[n]_k = Hom_\Delta([k],[n])$ and $\Delta[m]_k = Hom_\Delta([k],[m])$.
    A simplicial map  $\tilde{f} : \Delta[n] \to \Delta[m]$ consist of maps $\tilde{f}_k : \Delta[n]_k \to \Delta[m]_k$ for each $k \geq 0$.
    The most natural way to define a function from $\Delta[n]_k$ to $\Delta[m]_k$ is as follows:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each $k \geq 0$, define $\tilde{f}_k : \Delta[n]_k \to \Delta[m]_k$ by composition with $f$:
              \[
                  \tilde{f}_k(g) = f \circ g
              \]
              for all $g \in \Delta[n]_k = Hom_\Delta([k],[n])$.
    \end{itemize}


    Is this define a simplicial map? We need to check the naturality condition.


    Diagrammatically, for each morphism $\alpha : [l] \to [k]$ in $\Delta$, we need to check that the following diagram commutes:


    \[
        \begin{tikzpicture}[>=Stealth,baseline=(m.center)]
            \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=3em,column sep=5em,ampersand replacement=\&]
            {
                \mathrm{Hom}_\Delta([k],[n]) \& \mathrm{Hom}_\Delta([k],[m]) \\
                \mathrm{Hom}_\Delta([l],[n]) \& \mathrm{Hom}_\Delta([l],[m]) \\
            };
            \draw[->] (m-1-1) -- node[above] {$\tilde f_k$} (m-1-2);
            \draw[->] (m-1-1) -- node[left] {$\Delta(\alpha)$} (m-2-1);
            \draw[->] (m-1-2) -- node[right] {$\Delta(\alpha)$} (m-2-2);
            \draw[->] (m-2-1) -- node[above] {$\tilde f_l$} (m-2-2);
            % annotations outside
            \node[above=7mm of m-1-1] {$[n] \xrightarrow{f} [m]$};
            \node[left=7mm of m-1-1] {
                $\begin{matrix}
                        [k]             \\
                        \uparrow \alpha \\
                        [l]
                    \end{matrix}$
            };
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \]

    Starting from the top left corner and going clockwise, we have
    \[
        \tilde{f}_l(\Delta(\alpha)(g)) = \tilde{f}_l(g \circ \alpha) = f \circ (g \circ \alpha) = (f \circ g) \circ \alpha = \Delta(\alpha)(f \circ g) = \Delta(\alpha)(\tilde{f}_k(g)).
    \]
    Thus, the diagram commutes, and $\tilde{f}$ is indeed a simplicial map.

    Therefore, we have constructed a simplicial map $\tilde{f} : \Delta[n] \to \Delta[m]$ from an order-preserving map $f : [n] \to [m]$ in $\Delta$.

    Another way to see this map is to construct it using the tuple description of the standard simplices. Recall that $\Delta[n]_k$ consists of all non-decreasing sequences $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ with $0 \leq x_0 \leq x_1 \leq \cdots \leq x_k \leq n$. Given an order-preserving map $f : [n] \to [m]$, we can define the simplicial map $\tilde{f} : \Delta[n] \to \Delta[m]$ by applying $f$ to each entry of the tuple:
    \[
        \tilde{f}_k(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_k) = (f(x_0), f(x_1), \ldots, f(x_k)).
    \]
    Here, of course, we have $0 \leq f(x_0) \leq f(x_1) \leq \cdots \leq f(x_k)$, so $(f(x_0), f(x_1), \ldots, f(x_k))$ is indeed a non-decreasing sequence in $[m]$ with length $k$. This definition is consistent with the previous one, as composing a non-decreasing function $g : [k] \to [n]$ with $f$ results in a non-decreasing function $f \circ g : [k] \to [m]$.
    This definition is consistent with the previous one, as composing a non-decreasing function $g : [k] \to [n]$ with $f$ results in a non-decreasing function $f \circ g : [k] \to [m]$.

    \paragraph{}In particular, we can define the simplicial maps induced by the co-face and co-degeneracy maps in $\Delta$. As an instance , we have 2 maps from $[0]$ to $[1]$ in $\Delta$ which are the maps $d^0$ and $d^1$. They induce 2 simplicial maps from $\Delta[0]$ to $\Delta[1]$. We will write the induced maps as $\tilde{d_0}$ and $\tilde{d_1}$ respectively.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The map $d^0 : [0] \to [1]$ defined by $d^0(0)=0$ induces a simplicial map $\tilde{d_0} : \Delta[0] \to \Delta[1]$ given by
              \[
                  \tilde{(d_0)}_k(0,0,\dots,0) = (0,0,\dots,0)
              \]
              for all $k \geq 0$.
        \item The map $d^1 : [0] \to [1]$ defined by $d^1(0)=1$ induces a simplicial map $\tilde{d_1} : \Delta[0] \to \Delta[1]$ given by
              \[
                  \tilde{(d_1)}_k(0,0,\dots,0) = (1,1,\dots,1)
              \]
              for all $k \geq 0$.
    \end{itemize}

\end{example}





\paragraph{More Examples of Simplicial Sets}



\begin{example}[From ordered simplicial complex to simplicial set]
    Let $(V, \Delta)$ be an ordered simplicial complex. We can define a simplicial set $X$ as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each $n \geq 0$, let $X_n$ be the set of all ordered $n$-simplices in $\Delta$. That is,
              \[
                  X_n = \{ (v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n) \mid \{v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n\} \in \Delta, v_0 \leq v_1 \leq \cdots \leq v_n \}.
              \]
        \item The face maps $d_i : X_n \to X_{n-1}$ are defined by removing the $i$-th vertex from the ordered simplex:
              \[
                  d_i(v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n) = (v_0, \ldots, v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, \ldots, v_n) \quad (0 \leq i \leq n).
              \]
        \item The degeneracy maps $s_i : X_n \to X_{n+1}$ are defined by repeating the $i$-th vertex in the ordered simplex:
              \[
                  s_i(v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n) = (v_0, \ldots, v_i, v_i, v_{i+1}, \ldots, v_n) \quad (0 \leq i \leq n).
              \]
    \end{itemize}
    It is straightforward to verify that these face and degeneracy maps satisfy the simplicial identities. Thus, we have constructed a simplicial set from the ordered simplicial complex $(V, \Delta)$.
    The geometric realization of this simplicial set is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of the original ordered simplicial complex. Thus, simplicial sets can be viewed as a generalization of ordered simplicial complexes.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    The \emph{nerve} of a category $\mathcal{C}$ is a simplicial set defined as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each $n \geq 0$, let $N(\mathcal{C})_n$ be the set of $(n+1)$-tuples of composable morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$.
              \[
                  N(\mathcal{C})_n = \left\{
                  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=2.5em,ampersand replacement=\&]
                      C_0 \arrow[r, "f_1"] \& C_1 \arrow[r, "f_2"] \& \cdots \arrow[r, "f_n"] \& C_n

                  \right\}
              \]
        \item The face maps $d_i : N(\mathcal{C})_n \to N(\mathcal{C})_{n-1}$ compose the $i$-th and $(i+1)$-st morphisms in the sequence. That is, for a sequence of composable morphisms
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=2.5em,ampersand replacement=\&]

                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              the $i$-th face map ($0 \leq i \leq n$) is given by
              \[
                  d_i(f_1, \ldots, f_n) =
                  \begin{cases}
                      (f_2, \ldots, f_n)                            & i = 0             \\
                      (f_1, \ldots, f_i \circ f_{i+1}, \ldots, f_n) & 1 \leq i \leq n-1 \\
                      (f_1, \ldots, f_{n-1})                        & i = n
                  \end{cases}
              \]
        \item The degeneracy maps $s_i : N(\mathcal{C})_n \to N(\mathcal{C})_{n+1}$ insert an identity morphism at position $i$. That is, for
              \[
                  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=2.5em,ampersand replacement=\&]

                  \end{tikzcd}
              \]
              the $i$-th degeneracy map ($0 \leq i \leq n$) is
              \[
                  s_i(f_1, \ldots, f_n) = (f_1, \ldots, f_i, \mathrm{id}_{C_i}, f_{i+1}, \ldots, f_n)
              \]
              which corresponds to the diagram
              \[

\begin{example}[Nerve of a Group]
    Let $G$ be a group, and consider the category $BG$ with a single object $\ast$ and morphisms $\operatorname{Hom}(\ast, \ast) = G$. The nerve $N_\bullet(BG)$ is a simplicial set where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $N(BG)_n = G^n$ for $n \geq 0$ (by convention, $G^0$ is a singleton).
        \item The face maps $d_i : G^n \to G^{n-1}$ are given by:
              \[
                  d_i(g_1, \ldots, g_n) =
                  \begin{cases}
                      (g_2, \ldots, g_n)                      & i = 0             \\
                      (g_1, \ldots, g_i g_{i+1}, \ldots, g_n) & 1 \leq i \leq n-1 \\
                      (g_1, \ldots, g_{n-1})                  & i = n

              \]
        \item The degeneracy maps $s_j : G^n \to G^{n+1}$ are given by:
              \[
                  s_j(g_1, \ldots, g_n) = (g_1, \ldots, g_j, e, g_{j+1}, \ldots, g_n)
              \]
              where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}




\subsection{Basic constructions}

\paragraph{\textbf{Cartesian Product:}}
Given two simplicial sets $X, Y : \Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$, their \emph{cartesian product} $X \times Y$ is the simplicial set defined levelwise:
\[
    (X \times Y)_n = X_n \times Y_n
\]
for each $n \geq 0$. The face and degeneracy maps are defined componentwise:
\[
    d_i(x, y) = (d_i x, d_i y), \qquad s_i(x, y) = (s_i x, s_i y)
\]
for all $x \in X_n$, $y \in Y_n$, and $0 \leq i \leq n$.
There are natural projection maps $\pi_X : X \times Y \to X$ and $\pi_Y : X \times Y \to Y$ given by
\[
    \pi_X(x, y) = x, \qquad \pi_Y(x, y) = y.
\]
It is straightforward to check that these are simplicial maps.

\paragraph{\textbf{Subsimplicial Set:}}
A \emph{subsimplicial set} of a simplicial set $X$ is a simplicial set $Y$ such that for each $n \geq 0$, the set $Y_n$ is a subset of $X_n$ and the face and degeneracy maps of $Y$ are the restrictions of those of $X$.
We require that $Y$ is closed under face and degeneracy maps: for all $y \in Y_n$ and $0 \leq i \leq n$, we have
\[
    d_i y \in Y_{n-1}, \qquad s_i y \in Y_{n+1}.
\]

We can view also a subsimplicial set as a simplicial map $i : Y \to X$ such that each $i_n : Y_n \to X_n$ is an inclusion map. By definition of a subsimplicial set, this map is a simplicial map.

Conversely, if we have a simplicial map $f : Y \to X$ , then the image $f(Y)$ is a subsimplicial set of $X$. Take $f(Y)_n = f_n(Y_n) \subset X_n$ for each $n \geq 0$. Since $f$ is a simplicial map, $f(Y)$ is closed under face and degeneracy maps.

\paragraph{\textbf{Intersection of Subsimplicial Sets:}}
If $X ,Y $ are subsimplicial sets of a simplicial set $Z$, then their intersection $X \cap Y$ is defined levelwise by
\[
    (X \cap Y)_n = X_n \cap Y_n
\]
for all $n \geq 0$. Since both $X$ and $Y$ are closed under face and degeneracy maps, so is $X \cap Y$. In particular, if $z \in (X \cap Y)_n$ and $0 \leq i \leq n$, then
\[
    d_i z \in (X \cap Y)_{n-1}, \qquad s_i z \in (X \cap Y)_{n+1}.
\]

\paragraph{\textbf{Union of Subsimplicial Sets:}}
If $X ,Y $ are subsimplicial sets of a simplicial set $Z$, then their union $X \cup Y$ is defined levelwise by
\[
    (X \cup Y)_n = X_n \cup Y_n
\]
for all $n \geq 0$. Again, $X \cup Y$ is closed under face and degeneracy maps. Explicitly, if $z \in (X \cup Y)_n$ and $0 \leq i \leq n$, then
\[
    d_i z \in (X \cup Y)_{n-1}, \qquad s_i z \in (X \cup Y)_{n+1}.
\]

\paragraph{\textbf{Quotient Simplicial Set:}}
Given a simplicial set $X$ and an equivalence relation $\sim$ on each $X_n$ that is \emph{simplicial} (i.e.~compatible with the face and degeneracy maps), we can form the \emph{quotient simplicial set} $X/\sim$. The $n$-simplices of $X/\sim$ are the equivalence classes $[x]$ of $n$-simplices $x \in X_n$, and the face and degeneracy maps are defined by
\[
    d_i([x]) = [d_i x], \qquad s_i([x]) = [s_i x]
\]
for all $[x] \in (X/\sim)_n$ and $0 \leq i \leq n$.
A particular case is the quotient by a subsimplicial set.


\paragraph{\textbf{Boundary of the Standard $n$-Simplex:}}
The \emph{standard $n$-simplex} $\Delta[n]$ is the simplicial set $\hom_\Delta(-,[n])$.
Its \emph{boundary}, denoted $\partial \Delta[n]$, is the subsimplicial set of $\Delta[n]$ generated by the images of the simplicial maps induced by the coface maps
\[
    d^i : [n-1] \to [n], \qquad 0 \leq i \leq n.
\]
Formally,
\[
    \partial \Delta[n] = \bigcup_{i=0}^n \operatorname{im}(\tilde{d_i} : \Delta[n-1] \to \Delta[n]).
\]
Thus, $\partial \Delta[n]$ is the union of subsimplicial sets, so it is a subsimplicial set itself.
\paragraph{\textbf{Horn:}}
For each $0 \leq k \leq n$, the \emph{$k$-th horn} $\Lambda^n_k$ of $\Delta[n]$ is the subsimplicial set of $\Delta[n]$ generated by all the $(n-1)$-dimensional faces except the $k$-th one.
Formally,
\[
    \Lambda^n_k = \bigcup_{\substack{0 \leq i \leq n \\ i \neq k}} \operatorname{im}(\tilde{d_i} : \Delta[n-1] \to \Delta[n]).
\]
$\Lambda^n_k$ is a subsimplicial set because it is a union of subsimplicial sets.


\subsection{Degenerate and Non-degenerate simplices}

Let $X$ be a simplicial set. An $n$-simplex $x \in X_n$ is called \emph{degenerate} if there exists a degeneracy map $s_i : X_{n-1} \to X_n$ and $y \in X_{n-1}$ such that $x = s_i(y)$ for some $0 \leq i \leq n-1$. Otherwise, $x$ is called \emph{non-degenerate}.

Every 0-simplex is non-degenerate because there are no degeneracy maps coming to $X_0$.
for degenerate simplices, we have the following characterization
\begin{lemma}[Eilenberg–Zilber Lemma]
    Let $X$ be a simplicial set. An n-simplex $x \in X_n$ is either non-degenerate or   x can be   uniquely written as $x = s_{i_1} s_{i_2} \cdots s_{i_k}(y)$, where $y \in X_{n-k}$ is non-degenerate and $0 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k < n$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Now , if $x$ is non-degenerate, we are done. \\
    Otherwise, there exists a degeneracy map $s_i : X_{n-1} \to X_n$ and $y \in X_{n-1}$ such that $x = s_i(y)$ for some $0 \leq i \leq n-1$. If $y$ is non-degenerate, we are done. Otherwise, we can repeat the process. Since the dimension of the simplex decreases at each step, this process must terminate after a finite number of steps , which is at most $n$ steps. Therefore, we can write
    \[
        x = s_{i_1} s_{i_2} \cdots s_{i_k}(y)
    \]
    for some $y \in X_{n-k}$ that is non-degenerate and $0 \leq i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k < n$.
    Using the simplicial identities, we can further obtain a representation such that $0 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k < n$.\\

    Now, we will prove the uniqueness of this representation. Suppose that
    \[
        x = s_{i_1} s_{i_2} \cdots s_{i_k}(y) = s_{j_1} s_{j_2} \cdots s_{j_m}(z)
    \]
    for some $y \in X_{n-k}$ and $z \in X_{n-m}$ that are non-degenerate.

    Now we have a simplicial identity
    \[
        d_i s_i= id
    \]
    Define \[
        D_i=d_{i_k} \cdots d_{i_2}  d_{i_1}
    \]
    and
    \[
        D_j=d_{j_m} \cdots d_{j_2}  d_{j_1}
    \]


    Then we have    \[
        D_i(x) = D_i(s_{i_1} s_{i_2} \cdots s_{i_k}(y)) = y
    \] and
    \[
        D_j(x) = D_j(s_{j_1} s_{j_2} \cdots s_{j_m}(z)) = z
    \]
    Thus, we have $y = D_i(x)$ and $z = D_j(x)$.
\end{proof}






The set of non-degenerate $n$-simplices of $X$ is often denoted by $X_n^{ND}$.

Degenerate simplices are those that arise from lower-dimensional simplices by applying degeneracy maps, i.e., by "repeating" vertices. Non-degenerate simplices are those that cannot be written in this way.

\begin{example}
    In the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta[n]$, every $k$-simplex for $k < n$ is degenerate, except for the identity map $\mathrm{id}_{[n]} : [n] \to [n]$, which is non-degenerate in degree $n$.
\end{example}

A fundamental result about the structure of simplicial sets is the following:



This lemma implies that the data of a simplicial set is completely determined by its non-degenerate simplices and the simplicial identities.


\subsection{Geometric Realization of Simplicial Sets}
The geometric realization of a simplicial set $X$ is a topological space denoted by $|X|$. It is constructed by gluing together standard simplices according to the combinatorial data of the simplicial set.

More precisely, the $n$-simplices of $X$ are realized as standard $n$-simplices in Euclidean space, and the face and degeneracy maps are used to identify faces and degenerate simplices appropriately.

\begin{definition}[Geometric Realization]
    The geometric realization of a simplicial set $X$ is the topological space
    \[
        |X| = \coprod_{n \geq 0} X_n \times \Delta[n] / \sim
    \]
    where $\Delta[n]$ is the standard $n$-simplex and the equivalence relation $\sim$ identifies points according to the face and degeneracy maps.
\end{definition}





\section{Simplicial homotopy and Kan complexes}
We will recall the homotopy theory for topological space and we will try to translate it to simplicial sets.

\subsection{Classical homotopy theory}
In classical homotopy theory, two continuous maps
\[
    f,g : X \to Y
\]
between topological spaces are said to be \emph{homotopic} if there exists a continuous map
\[
    H : X \times [0,1] \to Y
\]
such that
\[
    H(x,0) = f(x) \quad \text{and} \quad H(x,1) = g(x) \quad \text{for all } x \in X.
\]
The map $H$ is called a \emph{homotopy} from $f$ to $g$.

Diagrammatically, this can be represented as:

\[
    \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large, column sep=large]
        X \times \{0\} \arrow[d,hook,"i_0"'] \arrow[dr,"f"] & \\
        X \times [0,1] \arrow[r,"H"] & Y \\
        X \times \{0\} \arrow[u,hook,"i_1"] \arrow[ur,"g"'] &
    \end{tikzcd}
\]

where
\[
    i_0(x,0) = (x,0), \qquad i_1(x,0) = (x,1).
\]

The relation ``$f$ is homotopic to $g$'' (denoted $f \simeq g$) is an equivalence relation on
\[
    C(X,Y) = \{\, f : X \to Y \mid f \text{ continuous} \,\}.
\]
The equivalence classes under this relation are called the \emph{homotopy classes of maps} from $X$ to $Y$, often denoted by $[X,Y]$.

We need to have a slightly general notion of homotopy.

\paragraph{}
A \emph{pointed space} is a pair $(X, x_0)$ consisting of a topological space $X$ together with a distinguished basepoint $x_0 \in X$.

\begin{definition}[Pointed Map]
    Let $(X, x_0)$ and $(Y, y_0)$ be pointed spaces. A \emph{pointed map} (or \emph{based map}) $f : (X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)$ is a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ such that $f(x_0) = y_0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Relative Homotopy]
    Let $f, g : (X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)$ be pointed maps. We say that $f$ and $g$ are homotopic relative to their basepoints if there exists a continuous map
    \[
        H : X \times [0,1] \to Y
    \]
    such that $H(x,0) = f(x)$, $H(x,1) = g(x)$ for all $x \in X$, and $H(x_0, t) = y_0$ for all $t \in [0,1]$.
\end{definition}

That is, a pointed homotopy deforms $f$ to $g$ through maps that all send the basepoint $x_0$ to $y_0$ at every stage.

The set of continuous pointed maps from $(X, x_0)$ to $(Y, y_0)$ is denoted  by $C((X, x_0), (Y, y_0))$.
The relation ``$f$ is  homotopic to $g$ relative to $x_0$''  is an equivalence relation on $C((X, x_0), (Y, y_0))$.
The set of  equivalence classes under this relation is denoted by $[(X, x_0), (Y, y_0)]$.





Using the homotopy relation, we define fundamental group and homotopy groups.








\paragraph{Homotopy Groups:}

Fix a basepoint $x_0 \in X$. The set of all loops based at $x_0$, modulo homotopy relative to the endpoints, forms a group under concatenation of loops.
This group is called the \emph{fundamental group} of $X$ at $x_0$, and is denoted by
\[
    \pi_1(X, x_0) =[(S^1, \ast  ),(X, x_0)].
\]
Generally, the $n$-th \emph{homotopy group} of $X$ at $x_0$ is defined as
\[
    \pi_n(X, x_0) =[(S^n, \ast  ),(X, x_0)].
\]

\paragraph{}
The case for $n=0$ is quite different. The set $\pi_0(X)$ is defined as the set of path components of $X$. That is, two points $x,y \in X$ are in the same path component if there exists a continuous map $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$ such that $\gamma(0) = x$ and $\gamma(1) = y$. This gives a equivalence relation on the set of points in $X$.


\subsection{Simplicial Homotopy}

\begin{definition}[Simplicial Homotopy]
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be simplicial sets, and let $f, g : X \to Y$ be simplicial maps. A \emph{simplicial homotopy} from $f$ to $g$ is a simplicial map
    \[
        H : X \times \Delta[1] \to Y
    \]
    such that $H(x, 0) = f(x)$ and $H(x, 1) = g(x)$.
\end{definition}

Diagrammatically, this can be represented as:

\[
    \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large, column sep=large]
        X \times \Delta[0] \arrow[d,hook,"{(\mathrm{Id}_X,\tilde{d_0})}"'] \arrow[dr,"f"] & \\
        X \times \Delta[1] \arrow[r,"H"] & Y \\
        X \times \Delta[0] \arrow[u,hook,"{(\mathrm{Id}_X,\tilde{d_1})}"] \arrow[ur,"g"'] &
    \end{tikzcd}
\]

Here $\tilde{d_0}, \tilde{d_1} : \Delta[0] \to \Delta[1]$ are the simplicial maps induced by the face maps $d^0 : [0] \to [1]$ and $d^1 : [0] \to [1]$ in $\Delta$.

The relation ``$f$ is simplicially homotopic to $g$'' (denoted $f \simeq g$) is called \emph{simplicial homotopy}.

\begin{remark}
    This is not an equivalence relation on $\mathbf{sSet}(X,Y)$ in general.
\end{remark}

---

For example, take $X = \Delta[0]$. Then maps $X \to Y$ correspond to $0$-simplices of $Y$, i.e. vertices.
We define the \emph{path relation} on $Y_0$ by declaring that
\[
    a \sim b \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \exists \,\sigma \in Y_1 \text{ with } d_1\sigma = a, \ d_0\sigma = b.
\]

This relation need not be symmetric.
Concretely, in the standard $1$-simplex $\Delta[1]$ we have the nondegenerate $1$-simplex $\sigma = (0,1) \in \Delta[1]_1$ with $d_0\sigma = 1$ and $d_1\sigma = 0$. Thus $0 \sim 1$, but there is no $\mu \in \Delta[1]_1$ with $d_0\mu = 0$ and $d_1\mu = 1$, so $1 \not\sim 0$.

It also need not be transitive. For example, in the simplicial set $Y = \Lambda_1^2$ (the $1$-st horn of the standard $2$-simplex), we have two nondegenerate $1$-simplices $\sigma = (0,1)$ and $\tau = (1,2)$ and three vertices $0,1,2$. Then $0 \sim 1$ and $1 \sim 2$, but there is no $1$-simplex connecting $0$ to $2$. Hence $0 \not\sim 2$.

Thus the path relation is not an equivalence relation in general.

---

To fix this problem, we require additional conditions on $Y$, leading to the concept of Kan complexes.

\subsection{Kan Complexes}

\paragraph{Path relation and horn filling.}
The failure of symmetry and transitivity above is explained by the inability to fill certain horns.
For instance:

- To prove transitivity,  if $a \sim b$ via a $1$-simplex $\sigma$ and $b \sim c$ via a $1$-simplex $\tau$, then we want  to show that $a \sim c$. Having 2 edges $\sigma$ and $\tau$ sharing a vertex $b$ means that we have a horn consisting of these two edges and the vertex $b$.
In other words, we have a simplicial map $\Lambda^2_1 \to Y$ sending the vertices $0,1,2$ of $\Lambda^2_1$ to $a,b,c$ respectively, and the edges $(0,1)$ and $(1,2)$ to $\sigma$ and $\tau$.
To establish a direct path from $a$ to $c$,
one would like to fill the horn $\Lambda^2_1$ to obtain a $2$-simplex providing a path from $0$ to $2$.In other words, there is 2 -simplex $\rho$ with $d_2\rho = \sigma$ and $d_0\rho = \tau$. Then $d_1\rho$ is a $1$-simplex from $a$ to $c$, establishing $a \sim c$.

- To prove symmetry, if $a \sim b$ via a $1$-simplex $\sigma$, we want to show that $b \sim a$. This can be also be viewed as filling a horn $\Lambda^2_0$ consisting of the edge $\sigma$ and the vertex $a$. Filling this horn gives a $2$-simplex $\rho$ with $d_1\rho = \sigma$. Then $d_0\rho$ is a $1$-simplex from $b$ to $a$, establishing $b \sim a$.
- To prove reflexivity, consider the $1$-simplex $s_0(a)$ from $a$ to $a$. So, we have $a \sim a$ without any extra condition.


Therefore, to ensure that the path relation is an equivalence relation, we need the ability to fill certain horns in $Y$.
Diagrammatically, if we have a simplicial map $\Lambda^2_k \to Y$ for $k=0$ or $k=1$, we want to extend it to a simplicial map $\Delta[2] \to Y$ making the diagram commute:


\[
    \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large, column sep=large]
        \Lambda^2_k \arrow[d,hook] \arrow[dr] & \\
        \Delta[2] \arrow[r,dashed] & Y
    \end{tikzcd}
\]

\paragraph{Kan condition.}

Path relation is an equivalence relation on $\mathbf{sSet}(\Delta[0],Y)$ if we can fill all horns $\Lambda^2_0$ and $\Lambda^2_1$.
To ensure that simplicial homotopy is an equivalence relation on $\mathbf{sSet}(X,Y)$, we need to be able to fill all horns $\Lambda^n_k$ for all $n \geq 1$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$.



\begin{definition}
    We say that a simplicial set $Y$ is a \emph{Kan complex} if the following holds:
    for every $n \geq 1$, every $0 \leq k \leq n$, and every simplicial map $\Lambda^n_k \to Y$, there exists a simplicial map $\Delta[n] \to Y$ making the diagram commute
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large, column sep=large]
            \Lambda^n_k \arrow[d,hook] \arrow[dr] & \\
            \Delta[n] \arrow[r,dashed] & Y
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
\end{definition}



Equivalently, in combinatorial terms:

\begin{definition}[Kan Complex]
    A simplicial set $X$ is a \emph{Kan complex} if for every $n \geq 1$, every $0 \leq k \leq n$, and every collection of $(n-1)$-simplices $\{x_i \in X_{n-1} : i \neq k\}$ satisfying the compatibility condition $d_j x_i = d_{i-1} x_j$ for all $i < j$, $i,j \neq k$, there exists an $n$-simplex $x \in X_n$ such that $d_i x = x_i$ for all $i \neq k$.
\end{definition}





\begin{proposition}
    If $Y$ is a Kan complex, then simplicial homotopy is an equivalence relation on the set of simplicial maps $X \to Y$ for any simplicial set $X$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
    Reflexivity and symmetry are straightforward. For transitivity, suppose $f \simeq g$ via $H$ and $g \simeq h$ via $K$. The Kan condition allows us to "fill in" the required simplices to construct a homotopy from $f$ to $h$ by gluing $H$ and $K$ along $g$. Thus, in Kan complexes, simplicial homotopy is transitive.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    The singular simplicial set $Sing(X)$ of a topological space $X$ is always a Kan complex. The nerve of a group is also a Kan complex.
\end{example}






\appendix


\section{Category Theory Basics}

Category theory provides a unifying language for much of modern mathematics, including algebraic topology.
We will use category theoretical framework to translate classical homotopy theory to more combinatorial theory.
We recall some basic definitions and examples.



\subsection{Categories}

\begin{definition}[Category]
    A \emph{category} $\mathcal{C}$ consists of the following data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A class of \emph{objects} (denoted $A, B, C, \dots$).
        \item For each pair of objects $A, B$, a set of \emph{morphisms} (or \emph{arrows}) $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A, B)$.
        \item For each triple $A, B, C$, a composition law: if $f \in \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A, B)$ and $g \in \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(B, C)$, then $g \circ f \in \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A, C)$.
        \item For each object $A$, an \emph{identity morphism} $\mathrm{id}_A \in \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A, A)$.
    \end{itemize}
    These satisfy:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Associativity:} $(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)$ whenever the compositions make sense.
        \item \textbf{Identity:} For all $f \in \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A, B)$, $\mathrm{id}_B \circ f = f = f \circ \mathrm{id}_A$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}


A category is a very general definition. The objects can be anything, and the morphisms can be any kind of structure-preserving maps. The key is that we have a way to compose morphisms and an identity morphism for each object.


\begin{itemize}
    \item [1]Categories as Structured Sets with Structure-Preserving Morphisms
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[(i)] \textbf{Set} Objects are sets, morphisms are functions between sets.
              \item[(ii)] \textbf{Top} Objects are topological spaces, morphisms are continuous maps.
              \item[(iii)] \textbf{Grp} Objects are groups, morphisms are group homomorphisms.
              \item[(iv)] \textbf{K-Vect} Objects are vector spaces over a field $k$, morphisms are linear maps.
              \item[(v)] \textbf{Rings:} Objects are rings (commutative or not, with or without identity, depending on context), morphisms are ring homomorphisms.
              \item[(vi)] \textbf{$R$-Mod} For a fixed ring $R$, objects are left $R$-modules, morphisms are $R$-linear maps.
              \item[(vii)] \textbf{Mnfld} Objects are smooth manifolds, morphisms are smooth maps.
              \item[(viii)] \textbf{Posets:} Any partially ordered set $(P, \leq)$ can be viewed as a category: objects are elements of $P$, and there is a unique morphism $x \to y$ if and only if $x \leq y$.
          \end{itemize}
    \item [2]Relations as Categories
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[(i)] \textbf{Equivalence Relations:} If $R$ is an equivalence relation on $X$, we can view $X$ as a category where:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Objects are elements of $X$.
                        \item There is a unique morphism $x \to y$ if and only if $x \sim y$ (i.e., $x$ and $y$ are equivalent).

                    \end{itemize}
                    Each equivalence class forms a connected component (a groupoid with only identity morphisms between distinct objects in the same class).

                    \begin{example}
                        Consider $X = \{a, b, c\}$ with the equivalence relation $ \sim ={(a,a),(b,b),(c,c),(a,b),(b,a)} $. The associated category has:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Objects: $a$, $b$, $c$.
                            \item Morphisms: For $x, y \in X$, a unique morphism $x \to y$ if $x \sim y$.
                        \end{itemize}
                        The morphisms are:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item $\mathrm{id}_a$, $\mathrm{id}_b$, $\mathrm{id}_c$ (identities)
                            \item $a \to b$, $b \to a$ (since $a \sim b$)
                        \end{itemize}

                        \begin{center}

                                \node (b) [right of=a] {$\ast\, b$};
                                \node (c) [below of=a, xshift=1.25cm, yshift=0.5cm] {$\ast\, c$};

                                \draw[->,thick] (c) to [out=120, in=60, looseness=8] (c);

                                \draw[->,thick,bend left=30] (a) to (b);
                                \draw[->,thick,bend left=30] (b) to (a);
                            \end{tikzpicture}
                        \end{center}


                    \end{example}


              \item[(ii)] \textbf{Posets:} If $R$ is a partial order $\leq$ on $X$, we get a category where:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Objects are elements of $X$.
                        \item There is a unique morphism $x \to y$ if and only if $x \leq y$.

                    \end{itemize}
                    This is called the \emph{poset category} associated to $(X, \leq)$.

                    \begin{example}
                        Consider the poset $X = \{a, b, c\}$ with $a < b < c$. The associated category has:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Objects: $a$, $b$, $c$.
                            \item Morphisms: There is a unique morphism $a \to b$, $b \to c$, and by composition $a \to c$. Each object has an identity morphism.
                        \end{itemize}
                        The diagram is:
                        \begin{center}
                            \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={font=\small}, node distance=2.5cm]

                                \node (b) [right of=a] {$b$};
                                \node (c) [right of=b] {$c$};

                                \draw[->,thick] (a) -- (b) node[midway,above] {};
                                \draw[->,thick] (b) -- (c) node[midway,above] {};
                                \draw[->,thick,bend right=30] (a) to (c);


                                \draw[->,thick,looseness=8,out=120,in=60] (a) to (a);
                                \draw[->,thick,looseness=8,out=120,in=60] (b) to (b);
                                \draw[->,thick,looseness=8,out=120,in=60] (c) to (c);
                            \end{tikzpicture}
                        \end{center}
                        Here, the morphisms are determined by the order: $a \to b$, $b \to c$, $a \to c$, and identities.
                    \end{example}

    \item [3]operations as Categories
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[(i)] \textbf{Group as a Category :}
                    A group $G$ can be viewed as a category $BG$ with a single object $\ast$, where every morphism $\ast \to \ast$ is an element of $G$. Composition of morphisms is given by group multiplication, and the identity morphism is the identity element of $G$.
                    \begin{center}

                        \end{tikzpicture}
                    \end{center}

              \item[(ii)] \textbf{Monoid as a Category :}
                    Similarly, a monoid $M$ can be regarded as a category $BM$ with one object $\ast$, where morphisms $\ast \to \ast$ are elements of $M$, composition is monoid multiplication, and the identity morphism is the identity element of $M$.

          \end{itemize}

\subsection{Functors}

\begin{definition}[Functor]
    Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories. A \emph{functor} $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ assigns:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To each object $A$ of $\mathcal{C}$, an object $F(A)$ of $\mathcal{D}$.
        \item To each morphism $f : A \to B$ in $\mathcal{C}$, a morphism $F(f) : F(A) \to F(B)$ in $\mathcal{D}$,
    \end{itemize}
    such that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $F(\mathrm{id}_A) = \mathrm{id}_{F(A)}$ for all $A$.
        \item $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)$ for all composable $f, g$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}


\begin{itemize}
    \item [1)]Categories as Structured Sets with Structure-Preserving Morphisms
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[(i)] \textbf{Forgetful Functor:} The forgetful functor $U : \mathbf{Grp} \to \mathbf{Set}$ sends a group to its underlying set and a group homomorphism to the underlying function.
              \item[(ii)] \textbf{Homology Functor:} For a fixed $n$, the $n$-th singular homology functor $H_n : \mathbf{Top} \to \mathbf{Ab}$ assigns to each topological space its $n$-th singular homology group, and to each continuous map the induced homomorphism on homology.
              \item[(iii)] \textbf{Free Abelian Group Functor:} The functor $F : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Ab}$ sends a set $X$ to the free abelian group generated by $X$, and a function $f : X \to Y$ to the group homomorphism extending $f$ linearly.
              \item[(iv)] \textbf{Vector Space with $X$ a Basis:} The functor $V : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Vect}_k$ sends a set $X$ to the vector space over $k$ with basis $X$, and a function $f : X \to Y$ to the linear map determined by $f$ on basis elements.
              \item[(v)] \textbf{Power Set Functor:} The functor $\mathcal{P} : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}$ sends a set $X$ to its power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and a function $f : X \to Y$ to the function $\mathcal{P}(f) : \mathcal{P}(X) \to \mathcal{P}(Y)$ given by $A \mapsto f(A)$.
          \end{itemize}
    \item [2)]Relations as Categories \\
          We leave the details of this case to the reader. A functor between two categories of relations corresponds to a function between the underlying sets that preserves the relation structure.
    \item [3)]Operations as Categories \\
          A functor between BG and BH corresponds to  a group homomorphism $f : G \to H$. A functor $F : BG \to Vect_K$ corresponds to a representation of the group $G$ on a vector space over a field $K$.



\end{itemize}


\subsection{Opposite Category}

\begin{definition}[Opposite Category]
    Given a category $\mathcal{C}$, the \emph{opposite category} $\mathcal{C}^{op}$ has the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$, but for $A, B$, $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}^{op}}(A, B) = \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(B, A)$. Composition is defined by $(f : B \to A)$ followed by $(g : C \to B)$ is $f \circ g : C \to A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    A contravariant functor $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is the same as a functor $F : \mathcal{C}^{op} \to \mathcal{D}$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Natural Transformations}

\begin{definition}[Natural Transformation]
    Let $F, G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ be functors. A \emph{natural transformation} $\eta : F \Rightarrow G$ assigns to each object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ a morphism $\eta_A : F(A) \to G(A)$ in $\mathcal{D}$ such that for every morphism $f : A \to B$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the following diagram commutes:
    \[
        \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
            \node (FA) at (0,1) {$F(A)$};
            \node (FB) at (2,1) {$F(B)$};
            \node (GA) at (0,0) {$G(A)$};
            \node (GB) at (2,0) {$G(B)$};
            \draw[->] (FA) -- node[above] {$F(f)$} (FB);
            \draw[->] (GA) -- node[below] {$G(f)$} (GB);
            \draw[->] (FA) -- node[left] {$\eta_A$} (GA);
            \draw[->] (FB) -- node[right] {$\eta_B$} (GB);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \]
    That is, $G(f) \circ \eta_A = \eta_B \circ F(f)$ for all $f$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    Let $F, G : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}$ be functors, with $F(X) = X \times X$ and $G(X) = X$. The map $\eta_X : X \times X \to X$ given by $\eta_X(x, y) = x$ defines a natural transformation from $F$ to $G$.
